# CLI Task Management Application

This is a basic CLI Task Management application written in C language.
It is my first project in C.

## Functionality
- Add new tasks
- Edit pre-existing tasks
- Mark tasks as complete
- List tasks added by user
- Delete tasks

## Future Functionality
- Mask tasks as incomplete
- Possibly convert it over to a GUI application with the use of GLFW
